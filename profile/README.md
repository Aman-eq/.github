Welcome to Aman, home of the Valar, a Lord of the Rings / Silmarillion themed server with custom items and currencies. This server will provide a unique Everquest experience that features npcâ€™s, quests, spells, and items that are based on the works of J. R. R. Tolkien.

Set thousands of years following the events of the Lord of the Rings, you are summoned to Aman, the Undying Lands and home of the Valar. The Dark Tyrant Morgoth and his allies have returned from the Void, igniting the events of the Dagor Dagorath (battle of all battles). In Aman you must choose between good and evil; to either help the Valar and the peoples of Arda, or to bring about their destruction.

Based on your initial faction choice (Iluvatar Faithful or Servants of Morgoth) you will begin in one of two hub towns: Alqualonde (good) or the Pelori Mountains (evil). Travel through Aman, which revamps EQ zones from the Gates of Discord expansion on (primarily Veil of Alaris).
